<%# Now, we need to create a form for a user to list a new puppy that is available for adoption. %>
<%# You can create this form in views/create_puppy.erb. %>
<%# Remember, you'll need to set up another controller action for a user to be able to view this %>
<%# form in the browser. Another reminder: the "submit" button of a form is an <input> element with %>
<%# a type of "submit", not a <button> element. %>

<form method="POST" action="/">
      <p>Puppy Name: <input type="text" name="name"></p>
      <p>Puppy Breed: <input type="text" name="breed"></p>
      <p>Puppy Age: <input type="text" name="age"></p>
      <input type="submit">
</form>
